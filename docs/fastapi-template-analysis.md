# Full Stack FastAPI Template Analysis

## Upstream Template

Repository:

https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template

Date tested:

July 25, 2026

## Test Environment

- Operating system: Windows
- Container platform: Docker Desktop with WSL 2
- Frontend URL: http://localhost:5173
- Backend URL: http://localhost:8000
- Swagger URL: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Setup Result

The Full Stack FastAPI Template was successfully built and started with:

```powershell
docker compose watch

The Docker setup successfully created and started the frontend, backend,
PostgreSQL, and supporting services.

## Features Tested
Feature	Result	Notes
Docker image build	Pass	Frontend and backend images built successfully
PostgreSQL startup	Pass	Database container reported healthy
React frontend	Pass	Login page and authenticated pages loaded
FastAPI backend	Pass	Backend responded successfully
Swagger documentation	Pass	OpenAPI documentation loaded at /docs
User registration	Pass	Multiple test accounts were created
User login	Pass	Registered users could log in
Authenticated dashboard	Pass	Dashboard displayed the current user
Create item	Pass	A new item could be created
Read item list	Pass	Created items appeared in the list
Edit item	Pass	Item title and description could be updated
Delete item	Pass	Item could be deleted successfully
User data isolation	Pass	A second user could not see the first user's items

##Expected Backend Root Behavior
Opening:
http://localhost:8000

returns:
{"detail": "Not Found"}

This is expected because the template does not define a route for /.
The FastAPI documentation is available at:
http://localhost:8000/docs

## Architecture Observed
The template includes:
FastAPI backend
React and TypeScript frontend
SQLModel data models
PostgreSQL database
JWT-based authentication
Alembic database migrations
Docker Compose configuration
Swagger and OpenAPI documentation
Generated frontend API client
Pytest backend tests
Playwright frontend tests
User-owned CRUD resources

## Components Potentially Reusable
The following components may be adapted for the issue tracker migration:
User model and authentication workflow
JWT token handling
Current-user dependency
PostgreSQL and SQLModel configuration
Alembic migrations
Owner-based resource authorization
CRUD endpoint structure
React application shell
Login and registration pages
Generated API client
Docker Compose configuration
Backend and frontend test structure

## Components Requiring Replacement or Extension
The template's generic Item feature is not sufficient for the planned
issue tracker.

It will need to be replaced or extended with:
Issue title and description
Status
Priority
Owner
Assignee
Comments
Sharing permissions
Filtering and sorting
Progress percentage
Progress history

## Relationship to the Existing Flask Application
The FastAPI template provides a strong technical foundation, but it does not
contain the collaboration and permission features found in the existing
Flask issue tracker.

The planned project should combine:
The verified workflows and permission rules from the Flask issue tracker
The authentication, database, API, frontend, testing, and Docker
architecture from the FastAPI template

## Planned Next Step

The next phase is to compare the two systems and design a concrete migration
map before importing substantial upstream code into the project repository.
