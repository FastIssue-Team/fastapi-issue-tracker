# Current System Analysis

## Upstream Application

Repository:

https://github.com/OmarMashal0/issue-tracker

Date tested:

July 25, 2026

## Test Environment

- Operating system: Windows
- Application framework: Flask
- Local URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Installation method: Python virtual environment and `requirements.txt`

## Setup Result

The original Flask issue tracker was successfully installed and started
locally.

The following command was used to run the application:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py

## Sharing and Permission Rules
The current application distinguishes between the issue owner and shared
users.
The issue owner can manage:
Title
Description
Status
Priority
Assignee
Sharing permissions
Deletion

A shared user can be granted permission to manage:
Status
Assignee

A shared user cannot manage:
Title
Description
Priority
Deletion
Sharing permissions

This permission behavior should be preserved during the FastAPI migration.

## Delete Operation Bug
Deleting an issue caused the following error:

TypeError: delete_item() missing 1 required positional argument: 'user_id'

The delete route in app.py calls:

delete_item(item_id)

However, the database function expects:

delete_item(item_id, user_id)

The route should provide the authenticated owner's user ID, conceptually:

delete_item(item_id, current_user.id)

The upstream source code was not modified during this testing phase. The
problem is documented so that the FastAPI implementation can provide a
correct and tested deletion endpoint.

## Current Architecture
The existing application uses:
Flask
Flask-Login
Flask-RESTful
SQLite
Jinja templates
HTML and CSS
Server-rendered pages

## Core Features to Preserve
The FastAPI migration should preserve:
User registration and authentication
Issue creation, viewing, editing, and deletion
Status and priority management
Issue assignment
Comments
Issue sharing
Granular shared-user permissions
Filtering and sorting

## Known Limitations and Improvement Opportunities
The issue deletion operation currently fails.
The application uses a server-rendered Flask architecture.
The database uses SQLite.
There is no issue completion percentage.
There is no progress history.
There is no project-level progress dashboard.
Some comment author information appears as a numeric value rather than a
clear username.
Automated testing appears limited.

## Planned Next Step
The next phase is to run and evaluate the Full Stack FastAPI Template before
selecting which components will be adapted into this project.
